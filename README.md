# ORCA OPEN ROCKET TRACKER 

Open source, low cost, long range (~10km) GPS tracker for rocketry. Uses a 4 layer board designed in Autodesk Fusion. Designed to fit in the smallest rockets at only 22mm x 40mm board size (plus antenna and battery you use). 

No radio licence required within Australia. A second board without the GPS or barometer installed can be used as a low base station to log position data via a serial input on a laptop.

## Programming the Wio-E5 STM32WLE5JC Module

### Connecting the STLINK debugger

Connect debug pins to (STLINK-V3MINIE)[https://www.st.com/resource/en/user_manual/um2910-stlinkv3minie-debuggerprogrammer-tiny-probe-for-stm32-microcontrollers-stmicroelectronics.pdf]

Use a OPENLINK connector to connect the STLINK to the Rocket tracker. The connection is the same as the Wio-E5 mini developer board. 

| Wio-E5 STM32WLE5JC | STLINK | 
|---|---|
| DIO | SWDIO / TMS / STDC14 PIN 4 / MIPI10 PIN 2 |
| CLK | SWCLK / CLK / STDC14 PIN 6 / MIPI10 PIN 4 |
| GND | GND / GND / STDC14 PIN 7 / MIPI10 PIN 5 |
| RST | RST / T_NRST / STDC14 PIN 12 / MIPI10 PIN 10 |
| 3V3 | VCC / T_VCC / STDC14 PIN 3 / MIPI10 PIN 1 |

Power the STLINK with a USB-C cable. 

Power the Wio-E5 STM32WLE5JC Module with another USB-C cable.

### Change read only protection to allow flashing with custom program

The first time you program a Wio-E5 STM32WLE5JC Module you need to remove Read-out Protection (RDP) first with STM32Cube Programmer.

1. Download STM32Cube Programmer and run
2. Connect the STLINK debugger 
3. Choose ST-LINK and set Reset Mode -> hardware reset -> Connect
4. Open the OB tab -> Change RDP to AA -> Apply

Once saved, this doesn't need to be done again.

### Programming via Arduino

Add the following board URL (under File / Preferences / Additional board URLs):

```txt
https://github.com/stm32duino/BoardManagerFiles/raw/main/package_stmicroelectronics_index.json
```
Under menu Tools/Board/Boards manager, search for STM32 and install 'STM32 MCU based boards'

Select the board: Tools -> Board -> STM32 MCU Based Boards -> LoRa board
Select the board number: Tools -> Boards part number -> Lora-E5-mini

The following libraries need to be added to flash the LORA_tx program in Arduino.

#include <RadioLib.h>
#include <SparkFun_u-blox_GNSS_Arduino_Library.h>
#include <MS5x.h>

Select the port connected to the to the STLINK debugger.

Flash the LORA_tx.ino to the transmitter, and the LORA_rx.ino to the base station reciever. 

### Debug Serial output

By default the LORA_tx program prints the sensor and transmit data to the serial monitor with a BAUD rate of 115200. Once you have the transmitter and reciever set up correctly set the debug to false (line 24 of LORA_tx.ino):

// -------------------
// Constants & Config
// -------------------
#define TX_PACKET_SIZE 25
#define TX_INTERVAL    500       // Transmit interval in ms (2 Hz)
bool debugEnabled    = false;    // Set to false to disable debug prints via serial

## Power and Charging 

The board can be powered with a 3.3V battery. The 3.3V battery can be charged via a USB-C cable. 

### LED power status 
* A red LED will show when powered.
* An orange LED will show when charging.
* The orange LED will turn off when fully charged and connected via a USB-C cable.
